# hello-world
Me doing Github's quickstart guide.

# Some stuff about myself
I'm doing the Odin Project right now.
I've taken some programming courses in university, but otherwise, I don't have much experience with building my own projects.

# Things I like/Hobbies
- playing the piano
- playing visual novels
- building gunpla (Gundam plastic models)
- anime (specifically, I like the artstyle)
- learning Russian

# Future aspirations
I hope I can either get a web developer or IT job.
